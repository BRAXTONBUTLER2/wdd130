    <h2> Some people call me Brax</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Braxton Butler; I'm a freshman majoring in computer science, and I hope to pursue a career in that field
         some day! I enjoy building computers as well as playing a lot of video games. One thing I love about this compus is how open
          it is and how many resources are availible to
        us students. I'm taking a web design class to see if that's something I would like to dive into further, potentially for a 
        career. Thanks!:
