      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        FAQs
        1. Is skydiving safe?

Skydiving is generally safe when conducted by experienced professionals and following safety protocols. The sport has a low fatality rate, with most accidents occurring due to human error or equipment malfunctions. Training, proper equipment, and adherence to safety guidelines are essential for a safe jump.
2. What is the age limit for skydiving?

The minimum age for skydiving varies by location but is typically around 18 years old. Some drop zones may allow younger participants with parental consent. There is no maximum age limit, but individuals above a certain age may require a doctor's approval.
3. Do I need any special skills or experience to go skydiving?

No prior experience or special skills are required for tandem skydiving, where you jump with a certified instructor. For solo jumps, you'll need to complete a training program, such as Accelerated Freefall (AFF), which teaches you the necessary skills.
4. How much does a skydive cost?

The cost of a skydive varies based on factors like location, jump type, and altitude. On average, tandem jumps can range from $200 to $300, while solo training programs may cost more. Be sure to check with your chosen drop zone for specific pricing.
5. How long does a skydive last?

Freefall typically lasts about 30 to 60 seconds, depending on the altitude of the jump. After deploying the parachute, the canopy flight can last an additional 5 to 7 minutes, providing a total skydiving experience of around 10 minutes.
6. What should I wear for a skydive?

Wear comfortable clothing, and dress appropriately for the weather conditions. Most drop zones provide jumpsuits to wear over your clothing, and you'll need closed-toe shoes, preferably with laces.
7. Can I bring a camera or GoPro on my jump?

Many drop zones allow you to bring a camera or GoPro on your jump, but there are strict safety guidelines for securing the equipment. It's essential to discuss this with your instructor and follow their instructions to ensure safe use.
8. What does it feel like to jump out of an airplane?

The sensation of jumping out of an airplane is a mix of exhilaration, adrenaline, and freedom. As you exit the aircraft, you'll experience a rush of wind and a brief moment of weightlessness during the freefall. It's an indescribable feeling that's both thrilling and awe-inspiring.
9. What happens if the parachute doesn't open?

Modern parachute systems are equipped with redundancies and automatic activation devices (AADs) that deploy the reserve parachute if the main one fails to open. Fatal parachute failures are extremely rare, thanks to these safety features and proper training.
10. Can I eat before a skydive?

It's advisable to eat a light, balanced meal a few hours before your jump to maintain energy levels. Avoid heavy or greasy foods, as they may cause discomfort during the jump. Staying hydrated is also essential. However, it's best to follow the specific dietary recommendations provided by your drop zone to ensure a safe and comfortable experience.
