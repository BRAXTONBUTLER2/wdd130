                    <div class="question">Age limit for skydiving</div>
                    <div class="answer">

                <div class="faq">
                    <div class="question">Special skills or experience</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>No prior experience or special skills are required for tandem skydiving, where you jump with a
                            certified instructor. For solo jumps, you'll need to complete a training program, such as
                            Accelerated Freefall (AFF), which teaches you the necessary skills.</p>

                <div class="faq">
                    <div class="question">Cost of a skydive</div>
                    <div class="answer">

                    <div class="question">Duration of a skydive</div>

                        <p>Freefall typically lasts about 30 to 60 seconds, depending on the altitude of the jump. After
                            deploying the parachute, the canopy flight can last an additional 5 to 7 minutes, providing a
                            total skydiving experience of around 10 minutes.</p>

                            provide jumpsuits to wear over your clothing, and you'll need closed-toe shoes, preferably with
                            laces.</p>

                            you exit the aircraft, you'll experience a rush of wind and a brief moment of weightlessness

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Modern parachute systems are equipped with redundancies and automatic activation devices (AADs)
                            that deploy the reserve parachute if the main one fails to open. Fatal parachute failures are
                            extremely rare, thanks to these safety features and proper training.</p>

                    <div class="question">Eating before a skydive</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>It's advisable to eat a light, balanced meal a few hours before your jump to maintain energy levels.
                            Avoid heavy or greasy foods, as they may cause discomfort during the jump. Staying hydrated is
                            also essential. However, it's best to follow the specific dietary recommendations provided by
                            your drop zone to ensure a safe and comfortable experience.</p>
